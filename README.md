# 1.2. Task details
This project aims to explore the development of a digital version of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" and focusing on the game`s mechanics, inplementation and user experience. By utilizing contemporary programing languages and development tools, we will create an interactive game that captures the essence of this age-old contest while incorporating modern features such as graphical user interfaces, score tracking and enhanced gameplay dynamics.
# 1.3. Student number and details
Student number: 12
Game: "Rock, Paper, Scissors"

# 1.4. Details about technology, program language and hardware
In this project I will use a client-server architecture. Client is an application that gets data from server and represented by Arduino board, which performs all the calculations and returns the results to the app. This project will be developed in C/C++/C# or Java language. Final decision I will make later.
